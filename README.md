<h1> Portfolio Project: Tankstorm</h1>
<p> Tankstorm is my end of second year project at Holberton. It's an online cooperative multiplayer game where two players fight against monsters spawning.</p>
<p>Both players will play the same character : a tank in an hostile zone.</p><br>
<p>A player will drive the tank and the other will shoot at enemies, on top of both players having unique abilites.</p>
<p>At the end of every rounds, the players will be able to upgrade their abilities. The more monsters you kill, the more gold you get to upgrade your tank.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, at the 5th round, the boss will spawn, there will not be any timer to finish the round, just kill it or die trying !</p>

# Technologies
For this project, I chose to use Unity and C#, with Unity Lobby and Unity Relay services, as well as Netcode for Gameobjects.

# How to play
<p>You can download the game [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16jqo-QTC7rxMG5UmivJTrs7jepn6F3ue/view?usp=sharing).</p>
<p>Notably, there is at this time an issue where the host of the lobby should only play as the driver of the tank. If the host plays the shooter, there might be unexpected behaviors that I'm debbuging.</p>

# Shortcuts
